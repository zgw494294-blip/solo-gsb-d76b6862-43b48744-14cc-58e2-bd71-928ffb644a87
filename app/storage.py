"""SQLite-backed persistence for registered graphs and the shared registry.

Two pieces of state survive restarts:

* the shared sensitive-column registry (entries keyed by ``(source, column)``)
  together with its monotonically increasing ``generation`` (0 on a fresh
  database, incremented once per successful whole-list replacement);
* every registered graph: its original ``nodes``/``export`` submission and the
  review result produced under the registry generation the graph was last
  reviewed at.

All reads and writes of the in-process state go through one lock, and a
replacement persists the new entries, the new generation and every graph's new
review result in a single explicit SQLite transaction: either the whole change
commits or nothing at all changes, so a registry can never be observed
together with stale conclusions — not even after a write or commit failure,
and not after the database is reopened.
